# Expectations of an Architect
### roles and responsibilities of architects
The first key to effectiveness and success in the software architect role depends on understanding and practicing each of these expectations.

- ### Make Architecture Decisions
An architect should `guide rather than specify technology choices` or might need to make specific technology decisions in order to preserve a particular architectural characteristic.

- ### Continually Analyze the Architecture
An architect is expected to continually analyze the architecture and current technology environment and `then recommend solutions for improvement`.

An architect must holistically analyze changes in technology and problem domains to `determine the soundness of the architecture`.

- ### Ensure Compliance with Decisions
Continually verifying that development teams are following the architecture decisions and design principles defined, documented, and communicated by the architect.

`By not ensuring compliance with architecture decisions`, the architecture `will not meet the required architectural characteristics` (‚Äú-ilities‚Äù), and the application or system `will not work as expected`.

- ### Have Business Domain Knowledge
`Without business domain knowledge`, it is difficult to understand the business problem, goals, and requirements, making it `difficult to design an effective architecture to meet the requirements of the business`.

`Without this knowledge`, an architect cannot communicate with stakeholders and business users and will `quickly lose credibility`. 

Using the domain knowledge and `language that these stakeholders know and understand`.

- ### Understand and Navigate Politics
The main point is that `almost every decision an architect makes will be challenged` by developers who feel their approach is better or due to `increased costs` or `increased effort (time)` involved.

The architect must navigate the politics of the company and `apply basic negotiation skills to get most decisions approved`.

Architectural Thinking
It is seeing things with an architectural eye, or an architectural point of view. 

### Architecture Versus Design
The architect and developer must be on the same virtual team to make this work.

An architect is responsible for things like `analyzing business requirements to extract and define the architectural characteristics` (‚Äú-ilities‚Äù), `selecting which architecture patterns and styles would fit the problem domain`, and `creating components` (the building blocks of the system). _The artifacts created from these activities are then handed off to the development team_, which is responsible for `creating class diagrams for each component`, `creating user interface screens`, and `developing and testing source code`.
